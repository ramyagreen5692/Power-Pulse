Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Understanding and Exploration
- Load the dataset
- Analyze structure, variables, and data quality
- Perform EDA to identify trends, outliers, and correlations

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing/inconsistent values
- Convert date and time columns
- Create new features (e.g., hour, weekday, rolling average)
- Normalize or scale numeric values

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Generate time-based features
- Aggregate or smooth data (daily averages, peak hours)
- Consider external features (e.g., weather data) if available

### 4. Model Building
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Try various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Neural Networks (optional)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RÂ² Score
- Analyze feature importance
- Visualize predicted vs. actual usage

### 6. Results & Insights
- Key trends in energy usage
- Time periods with highest/lowest usage
- Recommendations for energy optimization
